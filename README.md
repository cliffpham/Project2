## Description

## Purpose
 The main focus is to preserve that unique perspective of that oral history in a database. One of the major benefits of oral history for researchers and scholars is it’s ability to bring life to the voices and experiences of individuals, many whom might have otherwise have been forgotten by history. Our app will help build a bridge to connect others with similar experiences and help to connect researcher to those maybe forgotten oral history.
